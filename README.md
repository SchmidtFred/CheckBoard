# CheckBoard
## Summary
Checkboard is a web-app for list management based on the checkerboard lists seen in games such as "Kirby Air Ride" and "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". The goal is to provide users with a unique and fun way to work their way through to-do lists, bucket lists, and more.

### Features
* CheckBoards are generated from lists and reveal only a few options before expanding to show other items on the list
* Dynamic list creation which allows for different size boards up to 10 X 10
* User created lists may be marked public for other members to see and use
* User created lists are saved and able to be worked on later
* In progress CheckBoards are saved and able to be continued on a user by user basis (each user gets their own copy of the baord with a randomized layout)
